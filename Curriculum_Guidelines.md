# Curricular Guidelines

[Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3664191)

Our curricular guidelines are based on **Computer Science Curricula 2023 (CS2023)**, published in January 2024 by the Joint Task Force on Computer Science Curricula, a collaboration of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS), and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

**About Our Curriculum and CS2023 Guidelines:**

The CS2023 guidelines represent the latest recommendations for undergraduate computer science education, emphasizing a strong foundation in core concepts, ethical considerations, and practical application. Our OpenCS curriculum is designed to align closely with these guidelines, ensuring that our learners receive a comprehensive and relevant education.

**Key Aspects of Our Curriculum's Alignment with CS2023:**

* **Foundational Focus:** Our Phase 1, "Foundations (Core CS)," directly addresses the core Knowledge Areas (KAs) outlined in CS2023. This includes essential areas like Programming Fundamentals (PF), Discrete Structures (DS), Computer Organization and Architecture (CO), Operating Systems (OS), Algorithms and Complexity (AL), and Ethics and Professional Conduct (EPC).
* **Modular Structure:** Our curriculum is organized into modules, allowing for a structured and progressive learning path, mirroring the modular approach advocated by CS2023.
* **Emphasis on Mathematical Maturity:** We recognize the importance of mathematical foundations and provide comprehensive coverage of discrete mathematics and other relevant areas in Module 2.
* **Practical Application:** Module 4, "Foundational Applications," bridges the gap between theory and practice, demonstrating how core concepts are applied in real-world scenarios, which is a key goal of CS2023.
* **Ethical Awareness:** Module 5, "Fundamental Theory and Ethics," highlights the increasing importance of ethics in computer science, aligning with CS2023's emphasis on responsible computing.
* **Accessibility and Open Access:** Our commitment to providing free and open-source education aligns with the broader goals of CS2023 to promote accessibility and inclusivity in computer science education.

**Organizations Publishing CS2023:**

### The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)

The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is an international learned society for computing. Founded in 1947, it is the world's largest scientific and educational computing society. The ACM is a non-profit professional membership group with more than 100,000 members.

### Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a professional association formed in 1963 from the amalgamation of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers. As of 2018, it is the world's largest association of technical professionals with more than 423,000 members in over 160 countries. Its objectives are the educational and technical advancement of electrical and electronic engineering, telecommunications, computer engineering, and allied disciplines.

### Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)

The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) is a non-profit scientific society founded in 1979 devoted to advancing the scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behavior and their embodiment in machines. AAAI aims to promote research in, and responsible use of, artificial intelligence.

**Why This Matters:**

By aligning with CS2023, our curriculum ensures that learners are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the rapidly evolving field of computer science. It provides a benchmark for quality and relevance, ensuring that our graduates are well-prepared for both academic and professional pursuits.
