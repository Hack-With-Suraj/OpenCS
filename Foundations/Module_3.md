# **Module 3: Foundational Systems**

This module delves into the inner workings of computer systems, from the fundamental building blocks of hardware to the complex software that manages it. It covers computer architecture, operating systems, and computer networking.

## Why Study Foundational Systems?

Understanding these foundational concepts is essential for any serious computer scientist. It allows you to:

- **Write More Efficient Code:** Knowing how memory works, how processes are managed, and how networks function can help you write code that is optimized for performance.
- **Debug More Effectively:** When things go wrong (and they will!), understanding the underlying systems can help you diagnose and fix problems more quickly.
- **Design Better Systems:** Whether you're developing web applications, mobile apps, or embedded systems, a solid understanding of systems principles will enable you to design more robust and scalable systems.
- **Adapt to New Technologies:** The principles you learn in this module are applicable across a wide range of technologies. Even as new hardware and software emerge, the foundational concepts remain relevant.

## What You Will Learn in This Module

This module covers the essential systems concepts needed for a strong foundation in computer science, including:

- **Computer Architecture:** Understanding the organization and function of computer hardware components (CPU, memory, I/O).
- **Operating Systems:** Learning how operating systems manage hardware resources, handle processes, and provide services to applications.
- **Computer Networking:** Understanding how computers communicate with each other over networks.

## Programming Language for this Module

C is the recommended programming language for this module. It is essential for systems programming and working with low-level details of operating systems and hardware.

## Courses in This Module

This module incorporates highly regarded resources to provide a rigorous and comprehensive learning experience. We encourage you to dedicate significant time to mastering these concepts. Don't just complete the assignments; strive to deeply understand the underlying principles.

### Course 6: Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Parts I & II)

This project-based learning experience allows you to build a computer from the ground up, starting with logic gates and ending with a working software hierarchy. It provides an unparalleled understanding of how hardware and software interact.
