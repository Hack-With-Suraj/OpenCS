# **Module 4: Foundational Applications**

This module bridges the gap between the foundational concepts (programming, math, systems) and real-world applications of computer science. It explores key areas like databases, machine learning, computer graphics, and software engineering.

## Why Study Foundational Applications?

This module is crucial because it:

- **Provides Context:** It shows students how the theoretical knowledge they've gained can be applied to solve real-world problems.
- **Develops Practical Skills:** Students gain hands-on experience working with databases, machine learning tools, graphics libraries, and software engineering methodologies.
- **Explores Career Paths:** Exposure to these different application areas can help students discover their interests and choose a specialization.
- **Reinforces Foundational Concepts:** Working on projects in these areas reinforces the programming, mathematical, and systems concepts learned in earlier modules.

## What You Will Learn in This Module

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Databases:** Design and implement relational databases, write SQL queries, and understand database management principles.
- **Machine Learning:** Understand fundamental machine learning algorithms and apply them to real-world problems.
- **Computer Graphics:** Learn the basics of computer graphics, including 2D and 3D rendering and animation.
- **Software Engineering:** Apply software engineering principles to design, develop, and maintain software projects.

## Programming Languages for this Module

The choice of programming language for this module will depend on the specific courses and projects.

- **Databases:** SQL is essential. Python is commonly used for database interaction and data analysis.
- **Machine Learning:** Python is the dominant language due to its rich ecosystem of libraries.
- **Computer Graphics:** C++ is common due to performance. Python or JavaScript might be used depending on the course.
- **Software Engineering:** Python, Java, or other widely used languages are possible.
