# **Module 1: Programming Fundamentals**

At this stage, it's time to begin your programming journey. In a structured bachelorâ€™s-equivalent Computer Science curriculum, programming is the foundation of everything you will learn moving forward.

## Choosing Your First Programming Language

Programming is the foundation of computer science, and mastering it will open doors to various fields such as web development, artificial intelligence, data science, cybersecurity, and more.

### Why Start with Python?

We recommend starting with Python as your first programming language because:

*   âœ… **Beginner-Friendly:** Pythonâ€™s syntax is simple, clean, and resembles English, making it easy to read and write.
*   âœ… **Widely Used in Industry:** Python is used in AI, machine learning, web development, automation, data science, cybersecurity, and more.
*   âœ… **Strong Community Support:** Python has one of the largest programming communities, meaning plenty of resources, tutorials, and support are available.
*   âœ… **Faster Learning Curve:** Unlike languages like C++ or Java, Python lets you focus on learning programming concepts rather than complex syntax.

### What You Will Learn in This Module

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Write and debug Python code using variables, data types, operators, control flow structures (if/else, loops), and functions.
*   Design and implement object-oriented programs using classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
*   Work with common data structures such as lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
*   Read and write data to files and handle exceptions effectively.
*   Implement basic algorithms for searching and sorting.
*   Apply software engineering principles such as version control (Git) and code reviews.
*   Design programs following systematic and class-based design principles.
*   Understand and apply functional programming concepts.
*   Implement unit tests for your code.

### Why Python First? What About Other Languages?

Starting with Python gives you a strong foundation in programming concepts, making it easier to learn other languages like JavaScript, Java, C++, and Go in the future. Once youâ€™re comfortable with Python, learning another language mostly involves understanding syntax differences and specific features rather than learning programming from scratch.

ðŸš€ **Final Recommendation:** Start with Python to build a strong programming foundation. As you progress in OpenCS, you will also get exposure to other important languages such as JavaScript, C++, and Go, depending on your specialization.

## Courses in this Module

This module is designed to give you both a broad introduction to programming and a deep dive into software design principles.Â  It incorporates courses from MIT and other sources to provide a well-rounded learning experience.  OpenCS recommends dedicating at least 6 hours a day (36 hours a week) to your studies for optimal progress.

### Course 1: Introduction to CS and Programming using Python (MIT OpenCourseWare)

This course is aimed at students with little to no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident in their ability to write simple programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Python 3 programming language.

*   **Effort:** 8-10 hours/week
*   **Prerequisites:** None
*   **Resources:** [Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python](http://repo.darmajaya.ac.id/5070/1/Introduction%20to%20Computation%20and%20Programming%20Using%20Python%20by%20John%20V.%20Guttag%20%28z-lib.org%29.pdf)
*   **Discussion:** [Course 1 Discussion Forum]()Â *(Create a link to your discussion forum)*
*   **Link:** [Course 1: Introduction to CS and Programming using Python By MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/pages/material-by-lecture/)
*   **Mastery Hours:** Up to 100 hours.  Mastery hours are optional and intended for students who wish to explore topics in greater depth, work on additional projects, or delve into advanced concepts.

### Course 2: The Missing Semester of Your CS Education

Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but thereâ€™s one critical subject thatâ€™s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools. Weâ€™ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!

Students spend hundreds of hours using these tools over the course of their education (and thousands over their career), so it makes sense to make the experience as fluid and frictionless as possible. Mastering these tools not only enables you to spend less time on figuring out how to bend your tools to your will, but it also lets you solve problems that would previously seem impossibly complex.

*   **Effort:** 2 weeks (12 hours/week recommended)

*   **Mastery Hours:** Up to 40 hours.

### Course 3: Advancing Beyond Core Programming in OpenCS

This course builds upon the foundational programming concepts covered in the previous courses and delves into software design principles, advanced programming techniques, and exposure to different programming paradigms.Â  It draws inspiration from OSSU (Open Source Society University) to provide a deep, structured, and practical approach to programming.

*   **Effort:** Varies by sub-course (see below)
*   **Prerequisites:** Courses 1 and 2
