# Prerequisites for the OpenCS Curriculum

The OpenCS curriculum is designed to be accessible to motivated self-learners. While formal prerequisites are not strictly enforced, a solid foundation in certain areas will significantly contribute to your success. We strongly recommend the following:

## Essential Background

* **Basic Computer Literacy:** Familiarity with using a computer, navigating file systems, and using a web browser. You should be comfortable installing software and working with text editors.
* **Mathematical Maturity:** A general understanding of high school-level mathematics, including algebra, basic geometry, and functions. While calculus is not strictly required for all modules, a solid grasp of mathematical concepts will be beneficial.

### How to Review Math Prerequisites

If you need to review math topics, we recommend the following resources:

* **Lectures:** [Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorLeonard/playlists) (and associated numbered links).
* **Textbooks:** [OpenStax Math](https://openstax.org/subjects/math) (and associated links).
* **Assessments:** [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).

**Assessment and Review Process:**

1.  **Take a Khan Academy Assessment:** Start by taking a Khan Academy assessment for the relevant math level (Prealgebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Precalculus).
2.  **Identify Weak Areas:** After the assessment, identify the topics you need to review.
3.  **Use Recommended Resources:** Use the Professor Leonard lectures and OpenStax textbooks to study the identified topics.
4.  **Practice:** Complete the chapter review exercises in the OpenStax textbooks and work through examples in the lectures.

**Study Tips:**

* **Active Learning:** Pause the lecture videos before each question and try to solve it yourself.
* **Chapter Reviews:** Complete the chapter review exercises in the OpenStax textbooks.
* **Targeted Practice:** Use your assessment results to focus on areas you need to improve.
* **Multiple Resources:** Use multiple resources (textbooks, lectures, YouTube, Khan Academy) to gain a deeper understanding.
* **Community Support:** Ask for help in the relevant [Discord channel]().

## Recommended Preparation

While not mandatory, the following will greatly enhance your learning experience and prepare you for the more challenging aspects of the curriculum:

* **Pre-Calculus/Algebra Review:** If your high school math feels rusty, reviewing pre-calculus or algebra concepts (e.g., logarithms, trigonometry, functions) is highly recommended. Khan Academy or similar online resources can be very helpful.
* **Introduction to Programming (Optional but Highly Recommended):** Even a basic introduction to programming concepts (variables, loops, conditional statements) using a beginner-friendly language like Python or Scratch can make a big difference when you start Module 1: Programming Fundamentals. This will allow you to focus on the core concepts of CS rather than struggling with basic programming syntax.
* **Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving:** Practice with logic puzzles, riddles, or coding challenges (like those found on HackerRank or LeetCode) can help you develop the problem-solving skills essential for computer science.

## Specific Module Prerequisites (Where Applicable)

Some modules have specific prerequisites that build upon previous knowledge. These are clearly stated at the beginning of each module description. Pay close attention to these prerequisites before starting a module.

## Self-Assessment

Before starting the OpenCS curriculum, consider the following self-assessment questions:

* Are you comfortable working independently and managing your own learning schedule?
* Are you motivated and committed to dedicating significant time and effort to your studies?
* Are you comfortable seeking help and engaging with a learning community?
* Do you have a strong interest in computer science and a desire to understand how things work at a fundamental level?

If you can answer "yes" to most of these questions, you're likely well-suited for the OpenCS program.

## Bridging the Gap

If you feel you're lacking in some of the recommended preparation areas, don't be discouraged! Numerous free and paid online resources can help you build the necessary foundation. Khan Academy, Coursera, edX, and freeCodeCamp are excellent starting points. Take the time to strengthen your background before diving into the core curriculum. It will be a worthwhile investment in your future success.

## OpenCS's Approach

OpenCS is designed to be as accessible as possible. We provide resources and support to help learners of all backgrounds succeed. We believe that with dedication and hard work, anyone can learn computer science.
