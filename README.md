## About OpenCS

OpenCS is a comprehensive, open-source Computer Science curriculum designed for individuals seeking a deep, well-rounded understanding of fundamental computing concepts. It is ideal for learners who are self-motivated, disciplined, and committed to pursuing a rigorous CS education independently, supported by a global community of fellow learners.  It is *not* simply career training or professional development, but a true academic pursuit.

This curriculum mirrors the degree requirements of an undergraduate computer science major, excluding general education (non-CS) courses, as it is tailored for individuals who may already have education outside of CS. The courses included are world-class, sourced from institutions like Harvard, Princeton, MIT, and Stanford, and carefully selected based on:

*   ‚úÖ **Academic Rigor:** Ensuring a strong theoretical and practical foundation.
*   ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Coverage:** Covering core CS concepts, specializations, and real-world applications.
*   ‚úÖ **Accessibility:** Openly available, high-quality learning resources.

Upon completion of OpenCS, learners will possess knowledge and expertise equivalent to a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science, preparing them for industry roles, freelance work, research, and advanced studies.

üöÄ Inspired by [OSSU (Open Source Society University)](https://github.com/ossu) in [CS](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and [Mathematics](https://github.com/ossu/math), OpenCS follows a structured, progressive, and mastery-based approach, making world-class CS education accessible to all, for free.

# Prerequisites for the OpenCS Curriculum

The OpenCS curriculum is designed to be accessible to motivated self-learners, but a solid foundation in certain areas will significantly contribute to your success.  While formal prerequisites are not strictly enforced, we strongly recommend the following:

## Essential Background

*   **Basic Computer Literacy:** Familiarity with using a computer, navigating file systems, and using a web browser.  You should be comfortable installing software and working with text editors.
*   **Mathematical Maturity:**  A general understanding of high school level mathematics, including algebra, basic geometry, and functions.  While calculus is not strictly required for all modules, a solid grasp of mathematical concepts will be beneficial.

## Recommended Preparation

While not mandatory, the following will greatly enhance your learning experience and prepare you for the more challenging aspects of the curriculum:

*   **Pre-Calculus/Algebra Review:** If your high school math feels rusty, reviewing pre-calculus or algebra concepts (e.g., logarithms, trigonometry, functions) is highly recommended.  Khan Academy or similar online resources can be very helpful.
*   **Introduction to Programming (Optional but Highly Recommended):**  Even a basic introduction to programming concepts (variables, loops, conditional statements) using a beginner-friendly language like Python or Scratch can make a big difference when you start Module 1: Programming Fundamentals.  This will allow you to focus on the core concepts of CS rather than struggling with basic programming syntax.
*   **Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving:**  Practice with logic puzzles, riddles, or coding challenges (like those found on HackerRank or LeetCode) can help you develop the problem-solving skills essential for computer science.

## Specific Module Prerequisites (Where Applicable)

Some modules have specific prerequisites that build upon previous knowledge.  These are clearly stated at the beginning of each module description.  Pay close attention to these prerequisites before starting a module.

## Self-Assessment

Before starting the OpenCS curriculum, consider the following self-assessment questions:

*   Are you comfortable working independently and managing your own learning schedule?
*   Are you motivated and committed to dedicating significant time and effort to your studies?
*   Are you comfortable seeking help and engaging with a learning community?
*   Do you have a strong interest in computer science and a desire to understand how things work at a fundamental level?

If you can answer "yes" to most of these questions, you're likely well-suited for the OpenCS program.

## Bridging the Gap

If you feel you're lacking in some of the recommended preparation areas, don't be discouraged!  Numerous free and paid online resources can help you build the necessary foundation.  Khan Academy, Coursera, edX, and freeCodeCamp are excellent starting points.  Take the time to strengthen your background before diving into the core curriculum.  It will be a worthwhile investment in your future success.

## OpenCS's Approach

OpenCS is designed to be as accessible as possible.  We provide resources and support to help learners of all backgrounds succeed.  We believe that with dedication and hard work, anyone can learn computer science.
